# RLCSAM

We include here source code for the RLCSA used in our paper:

"Universal Indexes for Highly Repetitive Document Collections"
submitted to Information Systems Journal in April 2016 
by Claude, F; Fariña, F.; Martinez-Prieto, M.; and Navarro, G.

This code belongs to its author: Jouni Sirén, and we only include it in
this repository to allow our original experimental setup to be replicated.

A completed explanation about RLCSA and its possibilities can be found at
