according national climatic data center amp 8217 ghcn 2 data which composed 30 year smoothed climatic means thousands weather stations across world college weather station fairbanks alaska about 5 amp

famous colder regions earth because more snow falls there it acually much stronger tropical regions because tropics there consistently more sunlight when brazil ian ranchers cut down dark tropical rainforest trees replace them even darker soil order grow crops average temperature area allegedly increases average about 5 amp deg f year round difference would most likely more than 30 amp deg f if landscape rainforest was white instead dark green evidence this theory scientists have climbed top mount kilimanjaro tanzania which located area well described quot steaming jungle quot but kilimanjaro amp 8217 temperatures remain well below freezing all year round despite fact that its summit only about 20 000 feet above sea level assuming that average temperature sea level around kilimanjaro about 81 amp deg f this ghcn amp 8217 record average temperature dar es salaam nearby sea level weather station that temperature up mountain slope decreases only 2 amp deg f per 1 000 feet because semi moist environment it seems that temperature summit should about 41 amp deg f which much warmer than approximately 20 amp deg f that it has been estimated that kilimanjaro actually receives comparison hawaii volcano mauna loa which peaks about 14 000 feet has annual average temperature ghcn approximately 40 amp deg f despite fact that hawaii cooler drier environment than northern tanzania thus lapse rate there would expected higher thus resulting colder temperature summit mauna loa but there no snow top mauna loa reflect back incoming solar radiation although climate summit very rainy snow relatively rare coldest recorded temperature 14 amp deg f which reduced sea level rate 2 amp deg f gives 42 amp deg f which not much higher than lowest temperatures recorded other sea level stations hawaii average annual temperature sea level hawaii only about 74 amp deg f it during dry season dry 77 amp deg f so it can seen that lapse rate along slope mauna loa not significantly higher than 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet whereas kilimanjaro lapse rate almost doubled no logical reason only possible explanation that kilimanjaro glacier built up when climate was colder that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat keep itself cold enough not melt keep air temperature summit much lower than that atop mauna loa this very wide gap temperatures nearly 20 amp deg f occurs despite fact that skies above both mountains very cloudy climate both very wet so not much solar radiation reaches either summit if mauna loa were completely dry it could expected that its temperature would even warmer perhaps warm that tibet 14 000 feet summer another good example albedo action greenland greenland island covered almost completely ice winter very little sunlight reaches greenland so albedo not important but summertime it makes very big difference making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally given latitude elevation example eismitte weather station situated bit south geographical center island near 70 amp deg n altitude 9843 feet average temperature inland 0 feet 70 amp deg n eurasia north america july about 55 amp deg f given lapse rate 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet we could expect july average eismitte 35 amp deg f fact 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet often overestimate near poles because unusual convective activity that causes inversions arise there but actual average july temperature eismitte only 10 amp deg f furthermore next warmest month june only 2 amp deg f june being warmer than august clear sign that there some outside influences climate particular that sunlight plays unusually large role regulating temperature because june sunniest month year most northern part northern hemisphere but we cannot ignore fact that temperatures all summer months much colder than predicted values using 2 amp deg f lapse rate this obviously due very high albedo that greenland amp 8217 ice cap provides further evidence this theory can seen fact that other stations greenland have very low summer temperatures well fact relatively consistent all year round 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet lapse rate svalbard group islands extending about 75 amp deg n 80 amp deg n very warmest part arctic ocean part that bathed long stream warm water coming caribbean wintertime coastline most

average about amp 8211 20 amp deg f but have fallen low amp 8211 70 amp deg f this would unheard ice free areas islands some parts arctic ocean frozen over ice all year round these areas have unusual distinction experiencing heat convection coming ocean below well air above temperature purest arctic ocean water roughly 28 amp deg f all depths all seasons rocky bullwinkle 1970 temperature ice above however much colder because it reflects away some heat water below it during summertime upward face ice reflects away solar heat prevents itself melting completely ice that does melt helps keep average july temperatures north pole about 31 amp deg f albedo works smaller scale too people who wear dark clothes summertime put themselves greater risk heatstroke than if they wear white clothes ironically dark skin also serves aggravate heat loss during hot summer months although human body amp 8217 blood circulation much more powerful than albedo effect its skin thus children much skinnier

substance would have albedo 1 00 100 while black substance would have albedo 0 00 0 human eye perceives green light especially well so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think example albedo pine forest 45 amp deg n winter which trees cover land surface completely only about 9 walker 1987 among lowest any naturally occurring land environment ocean because it so deep even

amp 8217 study great plains winter around 45 amp deg n but different values latitude day they would different reason this not because amount sunlight coming which does not change substance amp 8217 albedo but because actual environments would different summer example cultivated field may come high low 20s depending crop being cultivated because increased photosynthesis all values forests swamp lands nearly doubled summer grassy field however remains 20 regardless season latitude near equator particularly rainforest areas soil very black its albedo very close 0 some shallow lakes may have albedos high 45 during times when sun striking lake very acute angle more its light reflected alpine areas often have strange albedo values because unusual land formations urban areas particular have very unnatural values albedo because many human built structures which absorb light before light can reach surface northern part world cities relatively dark walker has shown that their average albedo about 7 only slight increase during summer most tropical countries cities average around 12 this similar values found northern suburban transitional zones part reason this different natural environment cities tropical regions e g there more very dark trees around another reason that tropics very poor city buildings must built different materials snow greatest source albedo world albedo that can high 98 walker 1987 this ideal example however deep snow over treeless landscape no obstacles around real world maximum albedo depends environment thus even middle winter heavy snow cover albedo weather stations pine forested areas europe siberia americas rarely goes above 40 many stations this area have averages around 25 deciduous trees lose their leaves their albedos may rise mid 50 amp 8217 winter open prairie climates will average around 73 barren tundra averages about 80 icecap antarctica will average high 80s this essentially maximum possible albedo world rocky bullwinkle because trees such strong absorbers heat it seems logical that removing forests would tend cool earth whole this extremely complex subject there large amounts evidence both against this view some reasons that it may not true fact that tropical parts world soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than trees themselves that forested areas tend have higher cloud cover thus reflect away more heat anyway belief that earth regulating its own temperature thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect global temperature but fact remains that tree free environments where deep snow covers ground during winter have winter albedos 10 50 higher than nearby forested areas temperatures middle latitudes much 20 amp deg f colder over barrens near poles difference approaches zero because less sunlight coming first place if theory global warming true polar regions planet going rapidly warming up then magnitude path warming trend will depend largely albedo earth amp 8217 polar regions lesser extent albedo whole planet because warm days arctic mean heavier snowfalls extra snow will have negative feedback tending bring temperatures down masking warming effect but if temperature rises year round then summers some areas will warm enough melt snow ice completely thus feedback effect summer will become strongly positive example currently most northern part davis strait between canada greenland blocked ice year round summer temperatures very cold even its latitude because albedo if ice were melt very high albedo ice would replaced some very low albedo water temperatures would rise enormously perhaps much 15 amp deg f which would make area warmer than any other area that latitude this what accounts unusually warm summers islands svalbard norway but svalbard surrounded ocean whereas davis strait surrounded land thus has potential become even warmer than svalbard if ice melted then there would way warm waters gulf stream penetrate deep into arctic warm spells would become increasingly frequent this could accelerate melting arctic ocean process which would feed itself melted arctic would help many people living arctic areas but could possibly hurt many others living other parts globe fact those few remaining supporters old soviet plan melt arctic ocean rest their arguments largely fact that once ocean melted temperatures there would never become cold enough ice build up again their theory probably false climate models have shown that temperatures would still below freezing most year then because albedo would soon below freezing all year because ice would remain throughout summer average temperature north pole july estimated about 31 amp deg f rocky bullwinkle it estimated that without icecap that july would average around 42 amp

earth because more snow falls there it acually much stronger tropical regions because tropics there consistently more sunlight when brazilian ranchers cut down dark tropical rainforest trees replace

instead dark green evidence this theory scientists have climbed top mt kilimanjaro tanzania which located area well described steaming jungle but kilimanjaro temperatures remain well below freezing all year round despite fact that its summit only about 20 000 feet above sea level assuming that average temperature sea level around kilimanjaro about 81 f this ghcn record average temperature dar es salaam nearby sea level weather station that temperature up mountain slope decreases only 2 f per 1 000 feet because semi moist environment it seems that temperature summit should about 41 f which much warmer than approximately 20 f that it has been estimated that kilimanjaro actually receives comparison hawaiian volcano mauna loa which peaks about 14 000 feet has annual average temperature ghcn approximately 40 f despite fact that hawaii cooler drier environment than northern tanzania thus lapse rate there would expected higher thus resulting colder temperature summit mauna loa but there no snow top mauna loa reflect back incoming solar radiation although climate summit very rainy snow relatively rare coldest recorded temperature 14 f which reduced sea level rate 2 f gives 42 f which not much higher than lowest temperatures recorded other sea level stations hawaii average annual temperature sea level hawaii only about 74 f it during dry season dry 77 f so it can seen that lapse rate along slope mauna loa not significantly higher than 2 f per 1000 feet whereas kilimanjaro lapse rate almost doubled no logical reason only possible explanation that kilimanjaro glacier built up when climate was colder that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat keep itself cold enough not melt keep air temperature summit much lower than that atop mauna loa this very wide gap temperatures nearly 20 f occurs despite fact that skies above both mountains very cloudy climate both very wet so not much solar radiation reaches either summit if mauna loa were completely dry it could expected that its temperature would even warmer perhaps warm that tibet 14 000 feet summer b greenlandanother good example albedo action greenland greenland island covered almost completely ice winter very little sunlight reaches greenland so albedo not important but summertime it makes very big difference making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally given latitude elevation example eismitte weather station situated bit south geographical center island near 70 n altitude 9843 feet average temperature inland 0 feet 70 n eurasia north america july about 55 f given lapse rate 2 f per 1000 feet we could expect july average eismitte 35 f fact 2 f per 1000 feet often overestimate near poles because unusual convective activity that causes inversions arise there but actual average july temperature eismitte only 10 f furthermore next warmest month june only 2 f june being warmer than august clear sign that there some outside influences climate particular that sunlight plays unusually large role regulating temperature because june sunniest month year most northern part northern hemisphere but we cannot ignore fact that temperatures all summer months much colder than predicted values using 2 f lapse rate this obviously due very high albedo that greenland ice cap provides further evidence this theory can seen fact that other stations greenland have very low summer temperatures well fact relatively consistent all year round 2 f per 1000 feet lapse rate c svalbardsvalbard group

smaller scale too people who wear dark clothes summertime put themselves greater risk heatstroke than if they wear white clothes ironically dark skin also serves aggravate heat loss during hot summer months although human body blood circulation much more powerful than albedo effect its skin thus children much skinnier than adults need more clothes wintertime keep them warm even if they dark skinned however it has often been speculated neunke 2000 that dark hair might serve purpose keeping people warm during extremely cold weather since much heat escapes through head dr matthew neunke points out that russia example native peoples living furthest west where climate warmer have lightest hair whereas east they all dark haired this theory has never been satisfactorily proven however because many other bodily processes that keep people warm also it fails explain why majority aboriginal people living sunny tropical climates have dark hair well according neunke theory african aboriginal people should all light skinned red eyed white haired people northern europeans who survived ice ages should dark skinned swarthy dr neunke objects that blonde hair adaptation camouflage snow yellow snow apparently but this point it clear that he has no idea what he talking about dr neunke respected authority subject why white people innocent little angels who being outpopulated big evil black people but he has little knowledge meteorology medicine it can safely assumed that skin hair color has little effect person internal body temperature 5 real world environments there simple relationship between albedo area earth surface its color lighter color higher albedo white substance would have albedo 1 00 100 while black substance would have albedo 0 00 0 human eye perceives green

cities relatively dark walker has shown that their average albedo about 7 only slight increase during summer most tropical countries cities average around 12 this similar values found northern suburban transitional zones part reason this different natural environment cities tropical regions e g there more very dark trees around another reason that tropics very poor city buildings must built

deciduous trees lose their leaves their albedos may rise mid 50 winter open prairie climates will average around 73 barren tundra averages about 80 icecap antarctica will average high 80s this essentially maximum possible albedo world rocky bullwinkle 6 global warming overviewbecause trees such strong absorbers heat it seems logical that removing forests would tend cool earth whole this extremely complex subject there large amounts evidence both against this view some reasons that it may not true fact that tropical parts world soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than trees themselves that forested areas tend have higher cloud cover thus reflect away more heat anyway belief that earth regulating its own temperature thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect global temperature but fact remains that tree free environments where deep snow covers ground during winter have winter albedos 10 50 higher than nearby forested areas temperatures middle latitudes much 20 f colder over barrens near poles difference approaches zero because less sunlight coming first place if theory global warming true polar regions planet going rapidly warming up then

station that temperature up mountain slope decreases only 2 amp deg f per 1 000 feet because semi moist environment it seems that temperature summit should about 41 amp deg f which much warmer than approximately 20 amp deg f that it has been estimated that kilimanjaro actually receives comparison hawaii volcano mauna loa which peaks about 14 000 feet has annual average temperature ghcn approximately 40 amp deg f despite fact that hawaii cooler drier environment than northern tanzania thus lapse rate there would expected higher thus resulting colder temperature summit mauna loa but there no snow top mauna loa reflect back incoming solar radiation although climate summit very rainy snow relatively rare coldest recorded temperature 14 amp deg f which reduced sea level rate 2 amp deg f gives 42 amp deg f which not much higher than lowest temperatures recorded other sea level stations hawaii average annual temperature sea level hawaii only about 74 amp deg f it during dry season dry 77 amp deg f so it can seen that lapse rate along slope mauna loa not significantly higher than 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet whereas kilimanjaro lapse rate almost doubled no logical reason only possible explanation that kilimanjaro glacier built up when climate was colder that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat keep itself cold enough not melt keep air temperature summit much lower than that atop mauna loa this very wide gap temperatures nearly 20 amp deg f occurs despite fact that skies above both mountains very cloudy climate both very wet so not much solar radiation reaches either summit if mauna loa were completely dry it could expected that its temperature would even warmer perhaps warm that tibet 14 000 feet

albedo earth polar regions lesser extent albedo whole planet because warm days arctic mean heavier snowfalls extra snow will have negative feedback tending bring temperatures down masking warming effect but if temperature rises year round then summers some areas will warm enough melt snow ice completely thus feedback effect summer will become strongly positive example currently most northern

would never become cold enough ice build up again their theory probably false climate models have shown that temperatures would still below freezing most year then because albedo would soon below

temperature change due increase magnitude greenhouse effect all we would need do increase earth overall albedo about 12 adding more white clouds other scientists noting effect volcanic eruptions global temperatures have suggested other ideas some which actually practical stop global warming increasing earth albedo while all these solutions expensive would require cooperation powerful nations

thus lower its own temperature its value ranges 0 object which absorbs all radiation 100 object which reflects all radiation powdered charcoal has low albedo whilst mirror has relatively high albedo albedo object can used help determine it chemical composition every molecule every substance has its own albedo but albedo can also refer collection very many objects can even applied objects very large scale such planet earth which has albedo 37 39 since albedo can greatly affect temperature area it advantageous people especially cold climates settle areas where albedo very low so that they can get much warmth possible sun reverse true desert tropic tropical climates people want live areas where much solar radiation possible will emitted back into space according national climatic data center ghcn 2 data which composed 30 year smoothed climatic means thousands weather stations across world college weather station fairbanks alaska about 5 amp deg f warmer than airport fairbanks partly because drainage patterns but also largely because lower albedo college resulting higher concentration pine tree pine tree therefore less open snowy ground reflect heat back into space neunke kukla have shown that this difference especially marked during late winter months when solar radiation greater give another example entire nation belgium which among most urbanized world considerably warmer than mostly open unforested france french countryside that lies its immediate southwest perhaps also because albedo effects although albedo temperature effect most famous colder regions earth because more snow falls there it acually much stronger tropical regions because tropics there consistently more sunlight when brazil ian ranchers cut down dark tropical rainforest trees replace them even darker soil order grow crops average temperature area allegedly increases average about 5 amp deg f year round difference would most likely more than 30 amp deg f if landscape rainforest was white instead dark green evidence this theory scientists have climbed top mount kilimanjaro tanzania which located area well described quot steaming jungle quot but kilimanjaro temperatures remain well below freezing all year round despite fact that its summit only about 20 000 feet above sea level assuming that average temperature sea level around kilimanjaro about 81 amp deg f this ghcn record average temperature dar es salaam nearby sea level weather station that temperature up mountain slope decreases only 2 amp deg f per 1 000 feet because semi moist environment it seems that temperature summit should about 41 amp deg f which much warmer than approximately 20 amp deg f that it has been estimated that kilimanjaro actually receives comparison hawaii volcano mauna loa which peaks about 14 000 feet has annual average temperature ghcn approximately 40 amp deg f despite fact that hawaii cooler drier environment than northern tanzania thus lapse rate there would expected higher thus resulting colder temperature summit mauna loa but there no snow top mauna loa reflect back incoming solar radiation although climate summit very rainy snow relatively rare coldest recorded temperature 14 amp deg f which reduced sea level rate 2 amp deg f gives 42 amp deg f which not much higher than lowest temperatures recorded other sea level stations hawaii average annual temperature sea level hawaii only about 74 amp deg f it during dry season dry 77 amp deg f so it can seen that lapse rate along slope mauna loa not significantly higher than 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet whereas kilimanjaro lapse rate almost doubled no logical reason only possible explanation that kilimanjaro glacier built up when climate was colder that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat keep itself cold enough not melt keep air temperature summit much lower than that atop mauna loa this very wide gap temperatures nearly 20 amp deg f occurs despite fact that skies above both mountains very cloudy climate both very wet so not much solar radiation reaches either summit if mauna loa were completely dry it could expected that its temperature would even warmer perhaps warm that tibet 14 000 feet summer another good example albedo action greenland greenland island covered almost completely ice winter very little sunlight reaches greenland so albedo not important but summertime it makes very big difference making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally given latitude elevation example eismitte weather station situated bit south geographical center island near 70 amp deg n altitude 9843 feet average temperature inland 0 feet 70 amp deg n eurasia north america july about 55 amp deg f given lapse rate 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet we could expect july average eismitte 35 amp deg f fact 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet often overestimate near poles because unusual convective activity that causes inversions arise there but actual average july temperature eismitte only 10 amp deg f furthermore next warmest month june only 2 amp deg f june being warmer than august clear sign that there some outside influences climate particular that sunlight plays unusually large role regulating temperature because june sunniest month year most northern part northern hemisphere but we cannot ignore fact that temperatures all summer months much colder than predicted values using 2 amp deg f lapse rate this obviously due very high albedo that greenland ice cap provides further evidence this theory can seen fact that other stations greenland have very low summer temperatures well fact relatively consistent all year round 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet lapse rate svalbard group islands extending about 75 amp

unheard ice free areas islands some parts arctic ocean frozen over ice all year round these areas have unusual distinction experiencing heat convection coming ocean below well air above temperature purest arctic ocean water roughly 28 amp deg f all depths all seasons temperature ice above however much colder because it reflects away some heat water below it during summertime upward face ice reflects away solar heat prevents itself melting completely ice that does melt helps keep average july temperatures north pole about 31 amp deg f albedo works smaller scale too people who wear dark

between albedo area earth surface its color lighter color higher albedo white substance would have albedo 1 00 100 while black substance would have albedo 0 00 0 human eye perceives green light

relatively high albedo albedo object can used help determine it chemical composition every molecule every substance has its own albedo but albedo can also refer collection very many objects can even applied objects very large scale such planet earth which has albedo 37 39 since albedo can greatly affect temperature area it advantageous people especially cold climates settle areas where albedo

national climatic data center ghcn 2 data which composed 30 year smoothed climatic means thousands weather stations across world college weather station fairbanks alaska about 3 amp deg c 5 amp deg f

heat back into space neunke kukla have shown that this difference especially marked during late winter months when solar radiation greater give another example entire nation belgium which among most urbanized world considerably warmer than mostly open unforested france french countryside that lies its immediate southwest perhaps also because albedo effects although albedo temperature effect most famous colder regions earth because more snow falls there it acually much stronger tropical regions because tropics there consistently more sunlight when brazil ian ranchers cut down dark tropical rainforest trees replace them even darker soil order grow crops average temperature area allegedly increases average about 3 amp deg c 5 amp deg f year round difference would most likely more than 17

around kilimanjaro about 27 amp deg c 81 amp deg f this ghcn record average temperature dar es salaam nearby sea level weather station that temperature up mountain slope decreases only 1 amp deg c 2 amp deg f per 1 000 feet because semi moist environment it seems that temperature summit should about 5 amp deg c 41 amp deg f which much warmer than approximately 7 amp deg c 20 amp deg f that it has been estimated that kilimanjaro actually receives comparison hawaii volcano mauna loa which peaks about 14 000 feet has annual average temperature ghcn approximately 4 amp deg c 40 amp deg f despite fact that hawaii cooler drier environment than northern tanzania thus lapse rate there would expected higher thus resulting colder temperature summit mauna loa but there no snow top mauna loa reflect back incoming solar radiation although climate summit very rainy snow relatively rare coldest recorded temperature 10 amp deg c 14 amp deg f which reduced sea level rate 1 amp deg c 2 amp deg f gives 6 amp deg c 42 amp deg f which not much higher than lowest temperatures recorded other sea level stations hawaii average annual temperature sea level hawaii only about 23 amp deg c 74 amp deg f it during dry season dry 25 amp deg c 77 amp deg f so it can seen that lapse rate along slope mauna loa not significantly higher than 1 amp deg c 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet whereas kilimanjaro lapse rate almost doubled no logical reason only possible explanation that kilimanjaro glacier built up when climate was colder that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat keep itself cold enough not melt keep air temperature summit much lower than that atop mauna loa this very wide gap temperatures nearly 11 amp deg c 20 amp deg f occurs despite fact that skies above both mountains very cloudy climate both very wet so not much solar radiation reaches either summit if mauna loa were completely dry it could expected that its temperature would even warmer perhaps warm that tibet 14 000 feet summer another good example albedo action greenland greenland island covered almost completely ice winter very little sunlight reaches greenland so albedo not important but summertime it makes very big difference making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally given latitude elevation example eismitte weather station

rate 1 amp deg c 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet we could expect july average eismitte 2 amp deg c 35 amp deg f fact 1 amp deg c 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet often overestimate near poles because unusual convective activity that causes inversions arise there but actual average july temperature eismitte only 12 amp deg c 10 amp deg f furthermore next warmest month june only 17 amp deg c 2 amp deg f june being warmer than august clear sign that there some outside influences climate particular that sunlight plays unusually large role regulating temperature because june sunniest month year most northern part northern hemisphere but we cannot ignore fact that temperatures all summer months much colder than predicted values using 1 amp deg c 2 amp deg f lapse rate this obviously due very high albedo that greenland ice cap provides further evidence this theory can seen fact that other stations greenland have very low summer temperatures well fact relatively consistent all year round 1 amp

arctic winter temperatures northeast average about 29 amp deg c 20 amp deg f but have fallen low 57 amp deg c 70 amp deg f this would unheard ice free areas islands some parts arctic ocean frozen over

all seasons temperature ice above however much colder because it reflects away some heat water below it during summertime upward face ice reflects away solar heat prevents itself melting completely ice that does melt helps keep average july temperatures north pole about 1 amp deg c 31 amp deg f albedo works smaller scale too people who wear dark clothes summertime put themselves greater risk heatstroke than if they wear white clothes ironically dark skin also serves aggravate heat loss during hot summer months although human body blood circulation much more powerful than albedo effect its

higher albedo white substance would have albedo 1 00 100 while black substance would have albedo 0 00 0 human eye perceives green light especially well so green substances have albedos somewhat lower

cut down dark tropical rainforest trees replace them even darker soil order grow crops average temperature area allegedly increases average about 5 amp deg f year round difference would most likely more than 30 amp deg f if landscape rainforest was white instead dark green evidence this theory scientists have climbed top mount kilimanjaro tanzania which located area well described quot steaming jungle quot but kilimanjaro amp 8217 temperatures remain well below freezing all year round despite fact that its summit only about 20 000 feet above sea level assuming that average temperature sea level around kilimanjaro about 81 amp deg f this ghcn amp 8217 record average temperature dar es salaam nearby sea level weather station that temperature up mountain slope decreases only 2 amp deg f per 1 000 feet because semi moist environment it seems that temperature summit should about 41 amp deg f which much warmer than approximately 20 amp deg f that it has been estimated that kilimanjaro actually receives comparison hawaii volcano mauna loa which peaks about 14 000 feet has annual average temperature ghcn approximately 40 amp deg f despite fact that hawaii cooler drier environment than northern tanzania thus lapse rate there would expected higher thus resulting colder temperature summit mauna loa but there no snow top mauna loa reflect back incoming solar radiation although climate summit very rainy snow relatively rare coldest recorded temperature 14 amp deg f which reduced sea level rate 2 amp deg f gives 42 amp deg f which not much higher than lowest temperatures recorded other sea level stations hawaii average annual temperature sea level hawaii only about 74 amp deg f it during dry season dry 77 amp deg f so it can seen that lapse rate along slope mauna loa not significantly higher than 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet whereas kilimanjaro lapse rate almost doubled no logical reason only possible explanation that kilimanjaro glacier built up when climate was colder that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat keep itself cold enough not melt keep air temperature summit much lower than that atop mauna loa this very wide gap temperatures nearly 20 amp deg f occurs despite fact that skies above both mountains very cloudy climate both very wet so not much solar radiation reaches either summit if mauna loa were completely dry it could expected that its temperature would even warmer perhaps warm that tibet 14 000 feet summer another good example albedo action greenland greenland island covered almost completely ice winter very little sunlight reaches greenland so albedo not important but summertime it makes very big difference making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally given latitude elevation example eismitte weather station situated bit south geographical center island near 70 amp deg n altitude 9843 feet average temperature inland 0 feet 70 amp deg n eurasia north america july about 55 amp deg f given lapse rate 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet we could expect july average eismitte 35 amp deg f fact 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet often overestimate near poles because unusual convective activity that causes inversions arise there but actual average july temperature eismitte only 10 amp deg f furthermore next warmest month june only 2 amp deg f june being warmer than august clear sign that there some outside influences climate particular that sunlight plays unusually large role regulating temperature because june sunniest month year most northern part northern hemisphere but we cannot ignore fact that temperatures all summer months much colder than predicted values using 2 amp deg f lapse rate this obviously due very high albedo that greenland amp 8217 ice cap provides further evidence this theory can seen fact that other stations greenland have very low summer temperatures well fact relatively consistent all year round 2 amp deg f per 1000 feet lapse rate svalbard group islands extending about 75 amp deg n 80 amp deg n very warmest part arctic ocean part that bathed long stream warm water coming caribbean wintertime coastline most

average about amp 8211 20 amp deg f but have fallen low amp 8211 70 amp deg f this would unheard ice free areas islands some parts arctic ocean frozen over ice all year round these areas have unusual distinction experiencing heat convection coming ocean below well air above temperature purest arctic ocean water roughly 28 amp deg f all depths all seasons rocky bullwinkle 1970 temperature ice above however much colder because it reflects away some heat water below it during summertime upward face ice reflects away solar heat prevents itself melting completely ice that does melt helps keep average july temperatures north pole about 31 amp deg f albedo works smaller scale too people who wear dark clothes summertime put themselves greater risk heatstroke than if they wear white clothes ironically dark skin also serves aggravate heat loss during hot summer months although human body amp 8217 blood circulation much more powerful than albedo effect its skin thus children much skinnier than adults need more clothes wintertime keep them warm even if they dark skinned there simple relationship between albedo area earth amp 8217 surface its color lighter color higher albedo white substance would have albedo 1 00 100 while black substance would have albedo 0 00 0 human eye perceives green light especially well so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think example albedo pine forest 45 amp deg n winter which trees cover land surface completely only about 9 walker 1987 among lowest any naturally occurring land environment ocean because it so deep even lower about 3 5 surface temperature ocean equator allegedly over 100 amp deg f dense swampland averages between 9 14 deciduous trees average about 13 grassy field usually comes about 20 barren field will depend color soil can low 5 high 40 15 being about average farmland desert large beach usually averages around 25 but varies depending color sand all these measurements were taken edward walker amp 8217 study great plains winter around 45 amp deg n but different values latitude day they would different reason this not because amount sunlight coming which does not change substance amp 8217 albedo but because actual environments would different summer example cultivated field may come high low 20s depending crop being cultivated because increased photosynthesis all values forests swamp lands nearly doubled summer grassy field however remains 20 regardless season latitude near equator particularly rainforest areas soil very black its albedo very close 0 some shallow lakes may have albedos high 45 during times when sun striking lake very acute angle more its light reflected alpine areas often have strange albedo values because unusual land formations urban areas particular have very unnatural values albedo because many human built structures which absorb light before light can reach surface northern part world cities relatively dark walker has shown that their average albedo about 7 only slight increase during summer most tropical countries cities average around 12 this similar values found northern suburban transitional zones part reason this different natural environment cities tropical regions e g there more very dark trees around another reason that tropics very poor city buildings must built different materials snow greatest source albedo world albedo that can high 98 walker 1987 this ideal example however deep snow over treeless landscape no obstacles around real world maximum albedo depends environment thus even middle winter heavy snow cover albedo weather stations pine forested areas europe siberia americas rarely goes above 40 many stations this area have averages around 25 deciduous trees lose their leaves their albedos may rise mid 50 amp 8217 winter open prairie climates will average around 73 barren tundra averages about 80 icecap antarctica will average high 80s this essentially maximum possible albedo world rocky bullwinkle because trees such strong absorbers heat it seems logical that removing forests would tend cool earth whole this extremely complex subject there large amounts evidence both against this view some reasons that it may not true fact that tropical parts world soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than trees themselves that forested areas tend have higher cloud cover thus reflect away more heat anyway belief that earth regulating its own temperature thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect global temperature but fact remains that tree free environments where deep snow covers ground during winter have winter albedos 10 50 higher than nearby forested areas temperatures middle latitudes much 20 amp deg f colder over barrens near poles difference approaches zero because less sunlight coming first place if theory global warming true polar regions planet going rapidly warming up then magnitude path warming trend will depend largely albedo earth amp 8217 polar regions lesser extent albedo whole planet because warm days arctic mean heavier snowfalls extra snow will have negative feedback tending bring temperatures down masking warming effect but if temperature rises year round then summers some areas will warm enough melt snow ice completely thus feedback effect summer will become strongly positive example currently most northern part davis strait between canada greenland blocked ice year round summer temperatures very cold even its latitude because albedo if ice were melt very high albedo ice would replaced some very low albedo water temperatures would rise enormously perhaps much 15 amp deg f which would make area warmer than any other area that latitude this what accounts unusually warm summers islands svalbard norway but svalbard surrounded ocean whereas davis strait surrounded land thus has potential become even warmer than svalbard if ice melted then there would way warm waters gulf stream penetrate deep into arctic warm spells would become increasingly frequent this could accelerate melting arctic ocean process which would feed itself melted arctic would help many people living arctic areas but could possibly hurt many others living other parts globe fact those few remaining supporters old soviet plan melt arctic ocean rest their arguments largely fact that once ocean melted temperatures there would never become cold enough ice build up again their theory probably false climate models have shown that temperatures would still below freezing most year then because albedo would soon below freezing all year because ice would remain throughout summer average temperature north pole july estimated about 31 amp deg f rocky bullwinkle it estimated that without icecap that july would average around 42 amp deg f clouds another source albedo that play into global warming equation different types clouds have different albedo values theoretically ranging minimum near 0 maximum high 70s climate models such
