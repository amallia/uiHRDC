The contents of folder in     ../../../../no-pos.experiments.100gb/* could be moved to ..

    ## cp -r ../../../../no-pos.experiments.100gb/* ..

This would allow to run the experiments over the original 100gb collection (index creation , and mainly search scripts using the "already available" pre-built indexes that were built in our 256Mb-RAM machine). 
The source codes required are in ../../../II_DOCS_large

Anyway, this is out of the scope of this reproducibility paper.
