It is difficult to find an efficient (linear-time) and easy-to-use 
implementation of compressor RePair [Larson and Moffat 2000].
I have implemented such a compressor and decompressor (original and
balanced variants). It outputs the dictionary as a sequence of pairs, so
you can play with better representations of it.<p>

The code is <a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/software/repair.tgz">here</a>.</p><p>

</p><h3>Re-Pair based Web Graph Compression (2010)</h3>

The <a href="http://webgraphs.recoded.cl/">WebGraph ReCoded</a> site contains
free code for compressing Web graphs, performance results, and testbed data
(mostly pointers to the wider <a href="http://webgraph.dsi.unimi.it/">WebGraph</a> project). The related
articles are pointed from the site itself, and their preprints from my
pesonal publications page.<p>

This project derives from the MSc thesis of my student Francisco Claude.</p><p>

</p><h3>Libcds: Library of Compact Data Structures (2009)</h3>

It is a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/libcds">Google Code project</a>
containing implementations of several compact data structures for manipulating
bitmaps, sequences, trees, suffix trees, etc.<p>

It contains code contributed by my (ex)students Diego Arroyuelo, Rodrigo
Cánovas, Francisco Claude, Rodrigo González, and myself.</p><p>

This code is being moved to <a href="http://recoded.cl/">ReCoded</a> page as
well.</p><p>

</p><h3>Pizza&amp;Chili Site: Compressed Full-Text Indexing Corpus and Testbed
(2005)</h3>

The <a href="http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/">Pizza&amp;Chili Site</a> contains
free compressed full-text index implementations and testing test collections.
It is a joint effort with Paolo Ferragina, University of Pisa, and our
students Rodrigo González and Rossano Venturini.<p>

Get the <a href="ftp://ftp.dcc.uchile.cl/pub/users/gnavarro/survcompr.ps.gz">
technical report</a> where the current compressed indexes are surveyed, some of
which are implemented in the site.</p><p>

</p><h3>LZgrep: A Direct Compressed Text Search Tool (2003 and 2005) </h3>

This is the code corresponding to the paper "LZgrep: A Boyer-Moore String 
Matching Tool for Ziv-Lempel Compressed Text", by G. Navarro and J. Tarhio.
It contains improvements by Carlos Avendano Pérez.<p>

<a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/software/lzgrep.ps.gz">
Get the paper</a> that explains all the aspects of the software and 
appeared in <i>Software Practice &amp; Experience</i>.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/software/lzgrep.tar.gz">Get the code (version 0.99)</a>, which is a gzipped
tar with the copyright notice in a COPYRIGHT file. Build it with "make" and
run "lzgrep --help" to start.<br>
It is source code that has been tested on Solaris and Linux. Please see
copyright details and (absence of) warranties in the COPYRIGHT file.<br>
Note: option D-WM not yet implemented (works using D-SBOM). All the rest should
work.</p><p>

</p><h3>LZ-index: A Text Index based on the Ziv-Lempel Trie (2003) </h3>

This is the code corresponding to the paper "Indexing Text with the Ziv
Lempel Trie" and "Implementing the LZ-index: Theory and Practice", by
G. Navarro.<p>

Get either
<a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/ps/jda03.2.pdf">the paper already published in JDA</a> or
<a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/ps/techreports/jlzindex.ps.gz">the 
full technical report</a>, which explains all the aspects of the implementation
and parts thereof have been submitted to <i>ACM Journal of Experimental 
Algorithmics</i>.
</p><p>

<a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/software/lzindex-1.1.tar.gz">Get version 1.1 of the LZ-index</a>,
which is the current one. It differs from the original in a new <i>rank</i>
implementation obtained with Rodrigo González, Szymon Grabowski and
Veli Mäkinen, which made the index noticeably faster.
</p><p>

You can also <a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/software/lzindex-1.0.tar.gz">get version 1.0</a>, the original 
code tested in the JDA paper.
</p><p>

In the paper submitted to ACM JEA, a new version of the index is proposed that
takes 80% of the space of the original index and is up to 3 times slower for
short queries but almost similar on longer queries.
<a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/software/lzindex-smaller.tar.gz">Get the code</a> of that version.
It uses the improved <i>rank</i> function of version 1.1.
</p><p>

All codes come as gzipped tars with the necessary explanations in a README 
file and the copyright in a COPYRIGHT file. <br> 
They are source code that have been tested on Solaris and Linux.
</p><p>

The LZindex is compared against my particular implementation of the FMindex in 
the paper. <a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/software/fmindex.tar.gz">Get that implementation</a> if you want to
play with it. It is a gzipped tar with the necessary explanations in a README 
file and the copyright in a COPYRIGHT file. It contains source code that has 
been tested on Solaris and Linux. <br>

NOTE: This implementation follows the idea of Ferragina and Manzini's paper,
however, it has been optimized to use much more space, so I could make a fair
comparison against the LZindex, which is larger. You might instead be interested
in <a href="http://butirro.di.unipi.it/~ferrax/fmindex/index.html">their
implementation</a>.</p><p>

You can get <a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/software/sada.tar.gz">Sadakane's implementation</a> of his
Compressed Suffix Array I compared to in the paper.</p><p>

Finally, the <a href="http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/">PizzaChili site</a> 
contains newer versions of the LZ-index by Diego Arroyuelo, which require less
space.</p><p>
